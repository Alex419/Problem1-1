                <p>
                    Just in January, I traveled with the swim team on a 
                    training trip to Puerto Rico. We spent about 4 hours a day
                    training in the pool, but with the rest of our time, we 
                    were able to catch the waves and eat Puerto Rican food.
                    While the trip was extremely tiring, we had a great time!

                <p>
                    My favorite restaurant in the past couple of months
                    could just be Semolina right next to 574. Even though
                    I did spend a good amount of money, the portions actually
                    were big and the servers were nice. Of course the food 
                    was good as well.

                    <p>
                        My two favorite food are Steak and Mac and Cheese.
                        Steak is Medium rare and Mac and Cheese is just super
                        Cheesy. One of the best parts of the mac and cheese is 
                        the cripsy layer on top after you bake it in the oven.
